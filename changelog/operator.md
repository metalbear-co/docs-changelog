  aggregated by a custom key, specified by the new `primary_key` parameter.
  Check the
  [docs](https://metalbear.com/mirrord/docs/managing-mirrord/license-server#getting-a-utilisation-report-from-the-license-server)
  to learn more.


## 3.129.2 - 2025-11-13


### Added

- Added readiness probe in MySQL branch pod.


## 3.129.1 - 2025-11-05


### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the operator was overloading the Kubernetes API server with
  PATCH requests for `MirrordClusterSessions`.


## 3.129.0 - 2025-10-29


### Added

- Added multiple data copy modes for bootstrapping a MySQL branch.


### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the `scaledown` feature.
- Operator status not showing data for SQS split queues.


## 3.128.0 - 2025-10-21


### Added

- Added Kafka splitting info to the operator status.


### Changed

- API calls to MetalBear's servers (e.g: fetching the operator's license) now
  have a timeout, avoiding infinite hangs when the requests can't complete
  because of network settings.
- Improved logs for lingering temporary SQS queues.
- Updated the SQS empty-queue check, according to the SQS docs.


### Fixed

- Fixed a bogus error log related to `SingleWatchTask`.


## 3.127.1 - 2025-10-09


### Changed

- Improved pod stability check done during the `isolatePods` restart. Statuses
  of pod's containers are now taken into account.


## 3.127.0 - 2025-10-06


### Removed

- Removed the legacy method of exposing user session statistics with the
  `mirrordoperatoruser` resource.
  Usage can be tracked with the license server.


### Added

- Added a warning when an agent is slow to spawn (taking longer than 5
  seconds).


### Changed

- Adjusted log levels for various reconcilation logs produced by the operator.
- Changed the way how the operator creates empty MySQL database if
  a database name is given by the user. The operator now spawns the
  branch DB pod with a init container which creates the empty database.
  The new approach works around potential network policy that limits
  cross-namespace connections.


### Fixed

- Fix `OperatorSessionInfo::hostname` to return the actual hostname.


## 3.126.0 - 2025-09-16


### Added

- Added support for using an HTTP filter in traffic mirroring.


### Changed

- Create an empty database using the name in db brnaching configuration.
- `MirrordSqsSession` resources now have 4 random letters in their name.


### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the operator was not detecting conflicts between
  identical `any_of` HTTP filters.
- `MirrordSqsSession` resources that failed to start were not being deleted.


## 3.125.0 - 2025-09-11


### Added

- Add option to disable waiting for patched pods when starting queue splitting
  sessions.

  A new global operator configuration option
  `queue_splitting_wait_for_ready_target` has been added to control whether the
  operator waits for patched pods to become ready when starting Kafka/SQS
  splitting sessions. This option defaults to `true` (maintaining existing
  behavior) but can be set to `false` to speed up session start time in
  environments where pod readiness waiting is not necessary or causes delays
  due to cluster conditions.

  Configuration:
  - Environment variable: `OPERATOR_QUEUE_SPLITTING_WAIT_FOR_READY_TARGET`
  - Command line flag: `--queue-splitting-wait-for-ready-target`
  - Default: `true` (waits for ready pods)
- Report SQS splitting metrics to prometheus.
- The license server now logs the loaded license at startup.


### Changed

- Changed MySQL database branch's maximum TTL to 15 minutes.


### Fixed

- Fixed a bogus error log related to the `TargetWatch` task.
- Fixed a bug in the ArgoCD Rollout restart logic.
- Improved the formatting for license server usage reports, including tab names
  and number display formats.


## 3.124.0 - 2025-09-02


### Added

- Add mysql branch database CR controller and support for using mysql branches
  in connections to targets and copy targets.
- Created an endpoint at `/api/v1/reports/usage` in the license server to
  provide mirrord usage reports in .xlsx format.
- This version of the operator respects the new `workloadRestartTimeout` field
  in `MirrordWorkloadQueueRegistry`, that controls the timeout for the target
  workload to restart on the first SQS session start of a target.


### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where SQS sessions were failing with a `background task
  responsible for target monitoring is dead` error.
- Fixed a bug where sessions were sometimes failing with a port lock conflict
  after reconnecting to the operator.


## 3.123.1 - 2025-09-01


### Changed

- Removed the session ID from labels of Prometheus counters.


### Fixed

- Fixed a compatability issue with openapi v2 for operator CRDs.


## 3.123.0 - 2025-08-27


### Changed

- When the operator fails to find any applicable
  `MirrordWorkloadQueueRegistry`, the returned error contains names of all
  registries found in the session namespace.


### Fixed

- Fixed labels and buckets of the `mirrord_operator_ping_latency` Prometheus
  metric.


## 3.122.0 - 2025-08-22


### Added

- Added rtt metrics (prometheus) for checking mirrord and operator latency.
- Add metrics for stolen connections and stolen requests.
- Added `OPERATOR_SQS_SPLITTING_LINGER_TIMEOUT` configuration option,
  that allows for controlling how long (in millis) SQS splits can be kept alive
  when there are no more SQS sessions,
  but the are unconsumed unfiltered messages.


### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the operator was not handling stolen TLS messages
  correctly.
- The operator now returns more descriptive errors when it fails to spawn pod
  agents.

## 3.121.0 - 2025-08-13


### Added

- Added support for blocking `scale_down` when using `copy_target`.

## 3.120.0 - 2025-08-08


### Added

- Ignore configured containers and init containers when using the `copy_target`
  feature.

## 3.119.2 - 2025-08-06


### Changed

- Bumped mirrord dependencies version. Default mirrord-agent version is now 3.156.0.


## 3.119.1 - 2025-07-29


### Changed

- The operator now sends telemetry data to MetalBear's analytics server even if a license server is configured
  (unless telemetry is disabled).


### Fixed

## 3.119.0 - 2025-07-29


### Added

- Added support for fetching license files from Google Secret Manager
  (operator and license server).

  `isolatePods` restart, with a default value of 60 seconds.
  This allows the restart to always make progress, even in case of
  frequent/persistent pod failures.
- Added support for Kafka splitting with MSK.


### Changed

- Workflow dispatched from mirrord triggers operator e2e tests and waits for it
  to finish.
- All errors from failed SQS operations now contain the name or URL of the
  queue.


### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the operator was prematurely deleting SQS main output
  queues, failing pods in the target workload after the end of the session.


## 3.118.1 - 2025-07-22


### Added

- Added more informative logs to the code that calls MetalBear API.


### Fixed

- Improved SQS splitting code to remove the transient "registry is dirty" error

### Added

- Added a custom workload restart `IsolatePods` strategy, that can be enabled
  with `OPERATOR_ISOLATE_PODS_RESTART=true`.
  With this strategy, the operator will restart patched workloads by isolating
  workload pods from their replica set one by one.
  The new strategy can be used with mutating webhooks.
- Added support for selecting SQS queues environment variables with regular
  expressions.
- Added support for specifying a catch-all queue id (specified as `*` queue id)
  to SQS queue splitting. Only for SQS splits currently.

  ```json5
  {
        "split_queues": {
            // * means all queues under this target
            "*": {
                "queue_type": "SQS",
                "message_filter": {
                    "x-pg-tenant": "Aviram"
                }
            }
        }
  }
  ```
- Added support for using queue `fallback_name` in the MirrordWorkloadQueueRegistry.
  If source variables doesn't exist, fallback to that name.


### Changed

- Added validation when running license-gen to generate a new license (now we
  check for a bunch of things that would result in errors or warnings in the
  operator).
- Improved errors and warnings produced by the SQS splitting code.
- Validate a couple more things in license-gen command to avoid invalid license
  being created.


### Fixed

- Fixed issues with mirrord sessions using both the copy target and and the SQS
  splitting features.

  alive for the given session.


## 3.116.2 - 2025-07-01


### Changed

- The operator now prepares and creates copied pods in the background,
  returning an early success response from the create handler. The progress of

- Bump mirrord dependencies to 3.99.0
- On telemetry send error, don't drop all events - just truncate


### Fixed

- Fixed DAU/MAU counters not being reset
- Fixed the issue where stealing/mirroring from multi-pod targets would result
  in duplicate locks in operator status.


## 3.79.0 - 2024-04-14


### Added

- Add option to output logs in JSON format using `OPERATOR_JSON_LOG` = true
- Added an option to connect with the agents using TLS.


## 3.78.1 - 2024-04-10


### Changed

- Make copy job always run as user 1000
- Run operator as user to have better permissions control


### Fixed

- Reworked port locking: system-wide `PortLocks` holds all active port locks,
  layer-scoped `LayerPortLocks` owns port locks made by specific
  `LayerHandler`. Removed separate port locks info from the operator session.
- License validation now properly handles `4xx` responses from the licensing
  server. Such responses are now treated as non-transient and block usage.
- Copy job now sets terminationGracePeriodSeconds to 1 to fix cleanup issues


## 3.78.0 - 2024-04-03


### Changed

- Use the new agent config for agent-image + Bump mirrord version.


## 3.77.1 - 2024-03-06


### Fixed

- Re-add the OperatorSession event on end of session.


## 3.77.0 - 2024-03-03


### Added

- Adds operator's session management API exposed through kube. The new routes
  allows the user to `kill_all`, `kill_one` or `retain_active` sessions, and
  are (currently) available through `mirrord operator session` cli commands.


### Fixed

- Enable telemetry even if the user set OPERATOR_TELEMETRY_ENABLED to false
  (for teams licenses).
- For copy-target feature changed so creation of `pod_template` is done with
  impersonated client before copying said target to check the user is allowed
  to copy the resource.


## 3.76.2 - 2024-02-27


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


## 3.76.1 - 2024-02-27


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


## 3.76.0 - 2024-02-21


### Added

- Added support for Argo rollouts in `copy_target` feature.


### Fixed

- Remove always returning weird answer for any unmatching request, resolving
  issue when kube asks for OpenAPIv2 schema and we just say here take garbage..
- Fixed a bug where duplicate port locks where displayed in operator status
  when targeting multi-pod targets.


## 3.75.1 - 2024-02-13


### Fixed

- Fixed filtered steal port lock being displayed as mirror in operator status.
- Don't impersonate for copy job


## 3.75.0 - 2024-01-24


### Added

- Report port locks and filters in operator status


### Changed

- Make telemetry optional only on Enterprise, failing if no communication is
  done in max time (1h).
- Use the same operator certificate dates (valid_from, valid_to) for user
  certificates (the ones signed by the operator).
- User id is now produced from user certificate public key instead of
  fingerprint.


### Fixed

- Show local name and hostname in mirrord operator status
- Sidecars and init containers are now copied for deployments in copy feature


## 3.74.0 - 2024-01-16


### Added

- Extended certificate extension with additional data, exposed license
  generation methods, added license id to telemetry events


### Fixed

- Increased max headers from 100 to 1000


## 3.73.0 - 2024-01-14


### Added

- Add namespace to the session status
- Adds a LicenseExtension type that we insert into our certificates as an
  extension to distinguish between Teams and Enterprise.


### Changed

- Do not allow a teams license to be added using the local (certificate) file
  flow (reserved for enterprise license).
- Include copy targets in operator status.
- license_server url is now defined at compile-time only (either comptime env
  var, or default value).


### Fixed

- Fixed copy job idle timeout logic - the job now terminates immediately when
  the agent is unloaded.
  [#copy-job-ttl](https://github.com/metalbear-co/operator/issues/copy-job-ttl)


## 3.72.0 - 2024-01-08


### Added

- The operator checks the policies that applies to each run and blocks port
  subscription if forbidden by a policy.


### Changed

- Listing includes container targets for resources with multiple containers.


## 3.71.0 - 2024-01-05


### Added

- Added support for reading agent config from file so we can use configmap


### Changed

- Check if the license has been issued by us (also allows mock values via env
  var OPERATOR_LICENSE_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY). Refactored the initialization of
  OperatorLicense to take this into account.
- Change logging/tracing to only log on new/exit of functions instead of each
  enter/leave to reduce logs


## 3.70.0 - 2024-01-01


### Changed

- Operator now can run without certificate, falling back to creating
  self-signed on runtime


## 3.69.1 - 2023-12-26


### Changed

- Do not deny route access if the license check failed due to a network error.
  Implement From for converting between &LicenseError and TelemetryEvent.


### Fixed

- Fixed format of error responses. Errors are now handled properly by the
  `kube` create in the CLI.
- Add copying of init containers and side containers in copy feature
- Create copy target in configured default namespace (not kube's default
  namespace) if not specified.
- Fixed intervals of license checks.


## 3.69.0 - 2023-12-19


### Added

- Added license authorization check (via [axum
  middleware](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/middleware/index.html)) to block
  unlicensed/expired licenses from accessing certain functionalities in the
  operator.


## 3.68.1 - 2023-11-30


### Fixed

- Fixed connectionid reuse when deployment with multiple pods
